    <h2>Block</h2>
    <p>Block-level elements always start on a new line and take
      up the full width available (stretching left to right 
      as far as possible)
    </p>
    <div class="block">BLOCK</div>
    <div class="block">BLOCK</div>
    <p>Examples include div, nav, header,
      section, footer, and ul elements.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Inline</h2>
    <p>Inline elements do not start on a new line and
      only  occupy the space that their content requires.
      <span class="inline">INLINE</span>. Some examples of inline elemetns include
      span, input, label, select and a.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>inline-block</h2>
    <p>Inline-block is set by the CSS display property
      and differs to inline elements as we can set
      width and height. We cannot do this width
      inline elemetns as they only take the space their 
      content needs. Also, top and bottom margins 
      and paddings are respected, but inline elements
      they are not.
      <div class="inline-block">INLINE-BLOCK</div> <div class="inline-block">INLINE-BLOCK</div>. Unlike block-level elements,
      inline-block elements do not start on a new
      line and will sit next to other elements.
